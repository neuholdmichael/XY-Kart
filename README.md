# XY-Kart

## Motivation

The XY-Kart was developed as a part of our third-year project at the Higher Technical College Kapfenberg. This project allowed us to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, ultimately earning us top grades for our innovative approach and technical execution.

## Development Process

### Design and Construction

Our project utilized two Bluetooth modules to establish a wireless communication link between the transmitter and receiver. My teammate took charge of the mechanical aspects, meticulously designing the car's body (carosserie) and chassis using CAD software. The design process involved multiple iterations to ensure optimal weight distribution, aerodynamics, and aesthetic appeal.

### Electronics and Programming

I focused on the electronic components and programming. The assembly involved integrating various electronic modules, including the microcontroller, motor drivers, and sensors. The coding aspect was crucial; I programmed the transmitter to send control signals and the receiver to interpret these signals, thereby controlling the car's movement.

### Implementation and Testing

We conducted numerous tests to refine the responsiveness and reliability of the XY-Kart. Calibration of the sensors and fine-tuning the control algorithms were essential steps. These tests ensured that the car responded accurately to commands, providing a smooth and controlled driving experience.

### Documentation and Presentation

The project was comprehensively documented, detailing each phase from conceptualization to execution. This documentation, along with a live demonstration, was presented to our instructors and peers, showcasing the functionality and innovation of the XY-Kart.
